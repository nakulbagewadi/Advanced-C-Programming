Follow the instructions in the assignment.

This assignment deals with binary tree implementation. 
Read the input values from the input file and implement a binary tree. 
Create a tree node and add to the tree as you read input from the file. 
Travers the binary tree in pre-order, post-order and in-order both recursive and non-recursive implementations.  
Print output after each traversals, prompt the user to delete an element until the user quits. 
Please do not create an array to delete tree nodes. Print the binary tree output after deletion.

Hint: non-recursive implementations need the use of stack. 
As you visit the node, you need to stack the node in the required orded for traversal. 

Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods.

This is a average full credit assignment.
